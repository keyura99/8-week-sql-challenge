# ðŸŽ¬ Marketing Analytics Case Study

## ðŸ“Œ 1.0 Overview

### Business Task

We (Leadership team) have been asked to support the Customer Analytics team at DVD Rental Co who have been tasked with **generating the necessary data points** required to populate specific parts of this first-ever **customer email campaign**.

### Business Deliverables

The Marketing team have shared with us a draft of the email they wish to send to their customers.

We have summarized the data points to 7 parts.

Data Points | Email Item | What information do we need to find? | Flag Out to Marketing Team | 
----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------- |
1 & 4       | Top 2 Categories | Identify top 2 categories for each customer based off their past rental history. | - |
2 & 5       | Individual Customer Insights | For 1st category (2), identify total films watched, average comparison and percentile. For 2nd category (5), identify total films watched and proportion of films watched in percentage. | - |
3 & 6       | Category Film Recommendations | Identify 3 most popular films for each customer's top 2 categories that customer has not watched. | If customer does not have any film recommendations for either category. |
7, 8 &      | Favourite Actor Recommendation | Identify favourite actor with 3 film recommendations that have not been recommended. | If customer does not have at least 1 recommendation. |

## ðŸ“Œ 3.0 Data Exploration

Before we dive into problem-solving, let's explore the data!

### 3.1 Validating Data with Hypotheses

We will develop a few hypotheses and test them using SQL.

#### 3.1.1 Hypothesis 1

> The number of unique `inventory_id` records will be equal in both `dvd_rentals.rentals` and `dvd_rentals.inventory` tables.

````sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT inventory_id) -- As there are multiple inventory_id for each film_id, run DISTINCT to find unique inventory_id
FROM dvd_rentals.rental
````

<img width="83" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129328891-baee9de2-1d49-422a-a10b-9d15b61a70a6.png">

````sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(inventory_id)
FROM dvd_rentals.inventory;
````
<img width="91" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129328941-190879ee-18c4-47c8-94ac-bcd5b43c5575.png">

Looks like there are 4,580 `inventory_id` records in `dvd_rentals.rentals` and 4,581 `inventory_id` records in `dvd_rentals.inventory`. There is an additional 1 `inventory_id` record in `dvd_rentals.inventory`. 

#### 3.1.2 Hypothesis 2

> There will be a multiple records per unique `inventory_id` in the `dvd_rentals.rental` table.

````sql
WITH inventory_cte AS ( -- Generate a CTE using GROUP BY count of inventory_id
SELECT 
  inventory_id, 
  COUNT(*) AS inventory_id_count
FROM dvd_rentals.rental
GROUP BY inventory_id)
````

<img width="299" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129329083-786a002c-c5c5-4e46-9e44-5c2b6e80d207.png">

The table above shows the number of inventory records for each unique `inventory_id`. Then, we create a `CTE` and perform another grouping below.

````sql
SELECT 
  inventory_id_count,
  COUNT(*) AS inventory_id_grouping
FROM inventory_cte
GROUP BY inventory_id_count
ORDER BY inventory_id_count;
````

<img width="367" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129329125-c5c69fc4-e2c4-46df-b110-beb7a660cb30.png">

Ok, `inventory_id_count` represents the number of inventory records for each film and `inventory_id_grouping` is `inventory_id_count` grouped by the number of records.

For example, in 1st row, there is 1 inventory_id/ film that has 4 copies of inventory/film.

#### 3.1.3 Hypothesis 3
> There will be multiple `inventory_id` records per unique `film_id` value in the `dvd_rentals.inventory` table

````sql
WITH inventory_grouped AS (
SELECT 
  DISTINCT(film_id) AS unique_film_id, 
  COUNT(*) AS inventory_records_count
FROM dvd_rentals.inventory
GROUP BY film_id)
````

<img width="291" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129327670-a840f098-45fd-4851-a1ec-5d00d4336e0a.png">

````sql
SELECT 
  inventory_records_count, 
  COUNT(*)
FROM inventory_grouped
GROUP BY inventory_records_count
ORDER BY inventory_records_count;
````

<img width="283" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129329569-20591e56-d705-4dad-bfc0-d9c554b33ce3.png">

### 3.2 Foreign Key Overlap Analysis

#### 3.2.1 Rental and Inventory Table
Let's revisit the following findings,

> "Looks like there are 4,580 `inventory_id` records in `dvd_rentals.rentals` and 4,581 `inventory_id` records in `dvd_rentals.inventory`. There is an additional 1 `inventory_id` record in `dvd_rentals.inventory`."

We will perform an ANTI JOIN on `dvd_rentals.inventory` to find out what is the additional record.

First, let's confirm our hypothesis one more time.

````sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT i.inventory_id)
FROM dvd_rentals.inventory AS i
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT r.inventory_id
  FROM dvd_rentals.rental AS r
  WHERE i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id);
````

<img width="112" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129332739-6d11213d-06f2-4b31-a72e-1473a4dab1f9.png">

````sql
SELECT
  *
FROM dvd_rentals.inventory AS i
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT r.inventory_id
  FROM dvd_rentals.rental AS r
  WHERE i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id);
````

<img width="772" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129332786-0f2ee64f-cfee-4206-96b7-5c9e500e64e4.png">

We can make our assumption that this specific film is never rented by any customer, that's why it did not exist in the `rental` table which records only rental transactions. 

### 3.2.2 Inventory and Film Tables

Now, we will find out the relationship between `inventory` and `film` tables.

````sql
-- Find the number of unique film_id
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT film_id)
FROM dvd_rentals.film
````

<img width="95" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129337376-ebd83b0a-8547-4367-a18f-e4812c3d80ab.png">

There are 1,000 unique `film_id` records in `film` table.

````sql
-- Running ANTI JOIN to find out matching film_id records in both tables
SELECT 
  COUNT(*)
FROM dvd_rentals.film f
WHERE EXISTS
  (SELECT film_id
  FROM dvd_rentals.inventory i
  WHERE f.film_id = i.film_id)
````

<img width="90" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129337336-7b708918-4e00-42c9-a6d9-4d17a86d9178.png">

We will expect 958 records when we perform INNER JOIN between both tables.

CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_category_percentiles AS (
SELECT 
  customer_id,

WHERE customer_id = 1
ORDER BY percentile
LIMIT 5;
